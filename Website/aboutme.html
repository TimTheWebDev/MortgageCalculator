    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p id="par">My name is Timothy Sutzer. I am currently enrolled at Tech Elevator,
        a Java based full stack developer bootcamp in Detroit. I am seeking
        a junior developer job in the metro Detroit area. I have loved
        computers my whole life. Short of a hard drive failure, I can fix
        anything. Being a regional truck driver has taught me patience and
        how to work within tight deadlines. When the opportunity arose to
        change careers, I jumped at the chance to learn to program. The
        biggest lesson I have taken from bootcamp is learning to educate
        myself in this discipline. My personal areas of interest are financial
        technology, digital security, Vue.js, Java and continued learning
        through paired programming. </p>


    <h2>Discussion</h2>

    <h3>Goal</h3>
    <p id="par">The goal of this project was to write a deployable JS version of a Java
        command line mortgage calculator that I wrote using only my current
        skill set. Everything, except for an attributed regular expression,
        is my own.</p>
    <p id="par">The Code for the website and the original java project can be found
        <a href="https://github.com/TimTheWebDev/MortgageCalculator"  target="_blank">
            HERE.</a></p>


    <h3>Function</h3>
    <p id="par">The calculator takes in home cost, down payment, annual percentage rate
        and loan duration in years to generate the loan metrics and optionally,
        it will display the amortization schedule.</p>

    <h3>Structure</h3>
    <p id="par">For simplicity’s sake, I broke out the event listeners for the validation
        functions and the validation functions into their own JS files. The
        code could have been tighter but I opted for readability. All the code is commented to
        give insight into the smaller decisions.
        Calculate.js does the heavy lifting. It takes in the validated form
        data, instantiates the other variables, does the math and the optional
        for-loop generates the amortization schedule. I use a JS script to
        inject the schedule table header inside the if statement, before the
        for-loop and then the corresponding data. Some simple CSS formats the
        HTML pages. </p>

    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <p id="par">We are currently learning JS and the resulting application reflects
        the skills we have acquired to date. The goal of the project was to
        deploy the code. I can build a local database but the logistics of
        getting something working in the cloud will have to be a project for
        another day. </p>

    <p id="par">There was class discussion about validation in JS being easier than Java.
        They seem equally challenging, but the JS appears a little more
        intuitive on the page. This was the part of the project that was the
        most absorbing. Working out the math kinks went pretty quickly but
        under no circumstance did I want a bad input to blow up the page. The
        exclusions in Validator.js (lines 10, 26-28 and 38) originally didn’t
        include an empty string. The result of an empty field is a page of
        NaN’s. Adding the x == ”” exclusion resulted in the calculate button
        not working when there is an empty field. Because there was no event
        for the listener to detect, it couldn’t signal the error to the user.
        I spent a lot of time working on a validation function for the button
        that said that the three fields couldn’t be empty strings with no
        success. Sometimes the simplest solution is the best, I made the
        input required in the HTML. I wish it was more elegant but it works. </p>

    <p id="par">There are two issues that I haven’t solved. The first is limiting 
        the decimal places in the input. The field is taken in as text in the HTML
         where I could limit it using min, max and step in the input. The purpose of
        this exercise is to demonstrate a working knowledge of JS so changing
        the HTML defeats the purpose. Extra decimal places don’t blow up the code
        or have a tangible outcome numerically so I am content to leave it
        alone. </p>

    <p id="par">The second, is putting in an entry that violates the input fields 
        parameters correctly produces an invalid.  However, fixing it doesn't 
        change the error status.  The result is the calculate button ceases to 
        function and the form needs to be reloaded.  While I am not excited 
        about this, it is an unintended consequence of the way it is designed.  
        The lesson learned going forward is when dealing with simple numerical 
        inputs on a HTML form, take them in as numbers and let the HTML validate 
        them.  This project was designed to show a working knowledge of JS so I 
        am willing to live with it.  If anyone has a solution please feel free 
        to email me.</p>

    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p id="par">Because there is no back end and I have strictly limited the input,
        attacking the site would be difficult. Based on what we have learned so far,
        not having a back end inoculates me from most attacks.  Not having user data 
        or anything proprietary in the source code makes it very unlikely a hacker 
        would take the time to try.</p>
