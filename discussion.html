    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p></p>My name is Timothy Sutzer.  I am currently enrolled at Tech Elevator, 
    a Java based full stack developer bootcamp in Detroit.  I a seeking a 
    junior developer job in the metro Detroit area.  I have loved 
    computers my whole life.  Short of a hard drive failure, I can 
    fix anything.  I started my career as a regional truck driver
     and when the opportunity arose to change careers, I leapt at 
     the chance to learn to program.  The biggest lesson I have taken
      from bootcamp is learning how to learn.  Assimilating foreign 
      concepts as fast as bootcamp moves through the course was the 
      hardest thing to do.  My personal areas of interest are financial 
      technology, digital security, Node.js and Java.</p>
